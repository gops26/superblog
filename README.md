Hello pals this project is about building a *blog website architecture* using **Django Backend Framework**.\\
    The key Frameworks Used are\
      ***Django - Backend\
      Tailwind css - Cdn way integration\\***
I have decided to go with tailwind cdn(which is not recommended by tailwind) cause its easier to integrate as my motive is just to learn django framework which i think it will be useful for me in the career\
so i apologize for shit design for the website.
